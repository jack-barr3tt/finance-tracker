# Finance Tracker
Work-in-progress project to build a personal finance tracker app. This functions as an upgrade from a spreadsheet, but simpler than fancy apps like [Emma](https://emma-app.com). You would likely want this solution because you have multiple bank accounts and/or diverse investments, and can't (or don't want to) use the Open Banking service.

## Planned Features
- ğŸ•’ Multiple bank accounts
- ğŸ•’ Spending categories
- ğŸ•’ Sort/filter/aggregate spending
- ğŸ•’ Graphs/charts of spending and saving
- ğŸ•’ CSV imports
